# Week report 3

## What was done

JPS implementation. Most of this week was spent implementing and then debugging JPS.

## Questions

The JPS implementation is using a number of private methods that currently cannot be tested separately from the run method. Should they be made public for the sake of unit testing?

## Time spent this week:

* Research - 2h
* Implementation/debugging - 8h
* Other - 1h

**Total:** 13h

### Next week

Data structures, performance testing.
